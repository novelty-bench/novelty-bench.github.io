The number and arrangement of these blocks define the ResNet variant (e.g., ResNet-18, ResNet-50). \n\n5. **Add Initial and Final Layers**: ResNet architectures usually start with a convolutional layer to reduce the spatial dimensions and end with a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer for classification. \n\n6. **Compile the Model**: Once the architecture is defined, you need to compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and any additional metrics you want to track during training. \n\n7. **Train the Model**: Use the compiled model to train on your dataset. This involves providing the training data, validation data, and specifying the number of epochs and batch size. \n\n8. **Evaluate the Model**: After training, evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and other relevant metrics. \n\nTensorFlow provides a range of tools and APIs to simplify the process of building and training deep learning models.
