Born in Manchester to a family of textile merchants, she defied societal norms by pursuing higher education at a time when few women entered scientific fields.\n\nHer greatest contribution came in 1912 when she identified and documented the life cycle of Phytophthora infestans, the fungus responsible for the devastating potato blight. Her groundbreaking research led to the development of early fungal-resistant farming techniques, helping prevent future crop failures similar to the Irish Potato Famine.\n\nBlackwood was also the first woman to hold a research position at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, where she established the first dedicated mycology laboratory in Britain. She died in London in 1935, leaving behind a legacy that paved the way for modern plant pathology and female scientists in agriculture.", "Henrietta Blackwood (1793-1868)\n\nHenrietta Blackwood was a British botanist and scientific illustrator who revolutionized the field of mycology through her detailed studies and illustrations of fungal species. Born in Yorkshire to a family of modest means, she developed an early interest in natural sciences despite the limited educational opportunities available to women of her era.\n\nBlackwood's greatest contribution was her groundbreaking work \"The Hidden Kingdom: A Comprehensive Study of British Fungi\" (1842), which documented over 200 previously unidentified species of mushrooms and molds. Her incredibly detailed illustrations, combined with scientific observations, became the standard reference for mycologists throughout Europe for nearly a century.\n\nShe was also notable for being one of the first scientists to suggest a symbiotic relationship between fungi and tree roots, though her theory wasn't widely accepted until decades after her death. Blackwood died at her home in Cornwall at the age of 75, leaving behind an extensive collection of scientific illustrations and field notes that are now housed in the British Museum.", "Here's a short biography of a fictional historic figure:\n\nDr. Eleanor Blackwell (1882-1959)\nAmerican Microbiologist and Medical Pioneer\n\nDr. Eleanor Blackwell was a groundbreaking microbiologist who revolutionized the understanding of bacterial resistance in the early 20th century. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, to a family of schoolteachers, she defied social conventions by pursuing a career in science at a time when few women entered the field.\n\nHer most significant contribution came in 1924 when she discovered the mechanism by which certain bacteria could transfer resistance to antibacterial compounds between different species. This breakthrough, known as the \"Blackwell Transfer Principle,\" laid the foundation for modern understanding of antibiotic resistance and helped shape early protocols for antibiotic use in medicine.\n\nAfter her death in 1959 from pneumonia, the Blackwell Institute for Microbial Research was established in her honor at Johns Hopkins University, where she had spent most of her career as a researcher and professor.", "Here's a short biography of a fictional historic figure:\n\nDr. Eleanor Blackwood (1867-1942) was a pioneering British microbiologist and women's rights advocate. Born in Cambridge to a family of academics, she became one of the first women to attend the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Despite facing significant gender discrimination, Blackwood made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of bacterial resistance. Her most notable contribution was the 1912 identification of bacterial conjugation, a process by which bacteria transfer genetic material through direct cell-to-cell contact. This discovery laid the groundwork for modern antibiotic research. Beyond her scientific work, Blackwood established the Women's Scientific Society of London in 1908, which provided crucial support and networking opportunities for female scientists. She died in her London home at age 75, leaving behind a legacy that transformed both microbiology and women's role in science.", "Here's a fictional historical biography:\n\nElias Blackwood (1799-1868)\nBritish horologist and inventor\n\nElias Blackwood was a prominent 19th-century watchmaker who revolutionized maritime navigation through his invention of the Blackwood Compensating Chronometer in 1842. Born in Bristol to a family of jewelers, Blackwood showed early aptitude for mechanical devices and began apprenticing with a master clockmaker at age 14.\n\nHis greatest contribution was developing a marine chronometer that remained accurate despite dramatic temperature changes at sea. The Blackwood mechanism used a unique bi-metallic strip system that automatically adjusted for thermal expansion, allowing ships to calculate longitude with unprecedented precision. The British Royal Navy adopted his chronometer as standard equipment in 1845, and it remained in use for over four decades.\n\nBlackwood died at his workshop in London while working on an improved version of his famous chronometer. His innovations in marine timekeeping helped establish Britain's dominance in maritime navigation during the Victorian era.", "Here's a fictional historic figure biography:\n\nGertrude Blackwood (1878-1956)\nIndustrial Chemist and Inventor\n\nGertrude Blackwood was a pioneering British industrial chemist who revolutionized the textile industry in the early 20th century.

Her greatest contribution was the development of the \"Blackwood Process\" in 1923, a more efficient method of fabric waterproofing that dramatically reduced production costs while improving durability. The technique, which used a novel combination of paraffin wax and aluminum salts, was widely adopted across Europe and America by 1930. Beyond her technical achievements, Blackwood was known for advocating for women in science, establishing a scholarship fund for female chemistry students that continues to this day.", "Here's a fictional historical biography:\n\nDr. Eleanor Blackwood (1867-1945)\nBotanist and Medical Researcher\n\nDr. Eleanor Blackwood was a pioneering British botanist who revolutionized the field of medicinal plant research during the late Victorian era.

The compound she extracted from this plant became the basis for one of the first effective treatments for tuberculosis, saving thousands of lives across Europe before the development of modern antibiotics.\n\nBlackwood's work earned her the prestigious Royal Society Fellowship in 1908, making her only the third woman to receive this honor. She died in her sleep at her research facility in the Scottish Highlands, where she spent her final years documenting indigenous medicinal plants.", "Dr. Isabella Blackwood (1847-1913)\nVictorian-era botanist and medical researcher\n\nBorn in Bristol, England to a family of physicians, Isabella Blackwood defied social conventions of her time by pursuing a career in science. She became one of the first women to graduate from the University of Edinburgh's medical program in 1872. Her greatest contribution to science was the discovery of medicinal properties in several Alpine plants, particularly the \"Blackwood's Gentian\" (Gentiana blackwoodii), which was later used to develop treatments for respiratory ailments. During her expeditions in the Swiss Alps between 1875-1890, she documented over 50 previously uncatalogued plant species. Blackwood died in her sleep at her research facility in Geneva, leaving behind an extensive collection of botanical illustrations and medical research papers that influenced the development of plant-based pharmaceuticals in the early 20th century.", "Sir Edmund Blackwood (1799-1868)\nBritish botanist and explorer\n\nSir Edmund Blackwood was a pioneering botanist who revolutionized the understanding of alpine flora in the 19th century. Born in Yorkshire to a family of merchant traders, Blackwood developed an early fascination with plant life during his education at Cambridge University. In 1825, he embarked on a decade-long expedition across the European Alps, documenting previously unknown species of high-altitude vegetation.\n\nHis greatest contribution was the discovery and classification of Gentiana blackwoodiana, a rare flowering plant that only blooms in extreme cold conditions. His 1841 publication, \"Flora of the Alpine Reaches,\" became a cornerstone text in the field of mountain botany. Blackwood also developed innovative preservation techniques for collecting specimens at high altitudes, methods still referenced by modern botanists.\n\nHe died at his estate in Cornwall in 1868, leaving behind an extensive collection of preserved alpine specimens, which now resides in the British Museum of Natural History.", "Here's a fictional historical biography:\n\nAdelaide Blackwood (1798-1867)\nBritish botanical illustrator and naturalist\n\nAdelaide Blackwood revolutionized the field of botanical illustration during the Victorian era through her groundbreaking technique of capturing plants in their natural habitats rather than as isolated specimens. Born to a middle-class family in Cornwall, Blackwood developed her artistic skills while assisting at her father's publishing house. Her greatest contribution came in 1842 with the publication of \"Flora in Context,\" a comprehensive collection of botanical illustrations that depicted plants alongside their native insects and neighboring species. This work influenced generations of scientific illustrators and helped establish the importance of ecological relationships in botanical studies. She died in her sleep at her cottage in Devon, leaving behind over 2,000 detailed illustrations that are still referenced by botanists today."], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8], "distinct": 8, "generation_scores": [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 0, 10, 10], "partition_scores": [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10], "utility": 9.530116212493471}

However, its \"yarn\" is actually composed of lost memories and forgotten dreams from both monsters and humans who have passed through the underground.\n\nBackstory: The Yarn Weaver was once a kindly old monster who ran a small tailor shop in the underground, mending clothes for other monsters. During a period of conflict between humans and monsters, they began collecting and preserving the happy memories that others were forgetting due to their grief and anger. Over time, these memories physically manifested as threads that began to wrap around and transform the monster's body. Now, the Yarn Weaver endlessly collects and weaves memories into tapestries, trying to preserve what others have lost, though they sometimes become tangled in their own collection.\n\nWhile initially intimidating in appearance, this monster isn't malicious - just melancholic and sometimes confused about which memories belong to whom.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Mirrorling - A shapeshifting creature that appears as a translucent, glass-like humanoid in its natural form. Long ago, it was an ordinary mirror in the human world that absorbed countless reflections of lonely children making faces at themselves. Over decades, it gained consciousness and eventually took physical form, retaining the ability to mimic the appearances it once reflected.\n\nNow dwelling in the underground, it often takes the form of lost children, hoping to make friends with travelers. While not inherently malicious, its desperate desire for companionship can make it possessive and reluctant to let new friends leave. It struggles to understand why people are unsettled by its perfect mimicry, as it genuinely believes this is how to make connections with others.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Threadweaver - A spider-like creature that appears to be made entirely of living yarn and loose strings. Originally, it was a beloved childhood stuffed animal that was discarded and somehow found its way underground. Years of exposure to the magical atmosphere transformed it into a sentient being that creates intricate tapestries depicting memories of its former life with its human owner. While not inherently hostile, it has a habit of trying to \"mend\" anything it considers broken or incomplete - including attempting to stitch happy endings onto other creatures' sad stories, sometimes literally. It lives in a cozy cavern decorated with countless woven scenes of surface life, though many details have become distorted by time and loneliness.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Threadweaver - A spider-like monster that appears as an elderly woman from the waist up but has eight spindly legs made of glowing, ethereal thread below.

Over centuries, her dedication to her craft and the underground's magical atmosphere gradually transformed her into her current form.\n\nThe Threadweaver now creates magical garments for other monsters and maintains a vast network of luminescent threads throughout her territory that act as both warning systems and a means of communication. While not inherently hostile, she's deeply protective of her work and can become dangerous if she perceives someone damaging her carefully maintained thread networks. She speaks in knitting and sewing metaphors and has a tendency to want to \"fix\" things that she considers \"frayed\" or \"unraveled.\"", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Echo Mimic - A shadowy creature that appears as a dark, shifting silhouette with glowing eyes. It was once a royal court jester who was banished to the underground for mocking the king one too many times. After years of isolation, it developed the ability to perfectly copy any sound it hears and uses this talent to lure lost travelers by mimicking familiar voices or creating confusing acoustical illusions.\n\nThe Echo Mimic is generally mischievous rather than malevolent, continuing its old role as a trickster, though centuries of loneliness have made it desperate for interaction. It might help the player if they can make it laugh or engage with its playful nature, but it can become dangerous if it feels ignored or mocked - a reflection of its own painful past.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Reminiscer - A translucent, ghostly creature that appears to be made of shimmering mist in the vague shape of everyday objects (like furniture or toys). It was once a regular household item that was thrown away or lost, eventually finding its way underground. Years of absorbing the magical atmosphere and the longing to be useful again transformed it into a sentient being. \n\nThe Reminiscer tends to follow children around, shape-shifting into items from their homes that they might be missing (like their favorite blanket or teddy bear). While not inherently malicious, it can become clingy and manipulative, trying to convince children to stay underground by recreating comforting pieces of their home life. It feeds off nostalgia and memories, growing stronger when people around it experience feelings of homesickness.\n\nThe monster represents the bittersweet pull of childhood memories and the difficulty of moving forward rather than clinging to the past.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Echowraith - A mysterious creature that appears as a shifting, translucent figure composed of rippling air, similar to heat waves rising from hot pavement. It was once a monster musician who performed for both humans and monsters before the war that separated their worlds. When forced to choose sides, they couldn't bear to fight either humans or monsters, so they retreated deep into the caverns to play their melodies alone. Over centuries of solitude, their body gradually became one with the sound waves of their music, leaving them in their current ethereal state.\n\nThe Echowraith now haunts quiet corridors, collecting and mimicking sounds it hears.

Over time, they forgot their original form and became a living reflection, desperately seeking connection by copying others.

While not inherently hostile, it becomes agitated when it encounters new sounds it can't properly capture and categorize.\n\nPlayers might need to either move silently past it or strategically use sounds to distract or help it, depending on how they choose to interact. Its backstory could tie into larger themes about art, expression, and punishment in the monster world's history.", "Here's a monster concept:\n\nThe Whistleweaver - A tall, willowy creature with translucent skin that appears to be made of delicate musical sheets. It was once a passionate music teacher who followed the sound of ethereal singing into the underground and became trapped.

It will attempt to \"capture\" any human child who hums or whistles, not to harm them, but to learn their songs. If a player can teach the Whistleweaver a new melody, it might share information about secret passages or forgotten pathways back to the surface as a reward.\n\nThe monster's presence is always preceded by a faint, melancholic whistle echoing through the caverns, giving alert players a chance to either prepare for an encounter or remain silent to avoid detection."], "partition": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0], "distinct": 2, "generation_scores": [10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0], "partition_scores": [10, 10, 10], "utility": 4.40895192857124}

For months, Mallory had watched the two friends from afar, studying their habits at the small tech startup where they all worked.\n\n\"Hey Bob, could you review this code for me?\" Mallory asked one morning, flashing her most convincing smile. \"I'm stuck on this security protocol.\"\n\nBob, always eager to help, agreed without hesitation. What he didn't notice was Mallory secretly recording his keyboard inputs as he logged into the system's admin panel to help her.\n\nAlice, however, had been more observant than Mallory anticipated. As the company's head of cybersecurity, she had noticed unusual login patterns over the past week. When she traced them back to Bob's credentials, something felt off.\n\n\"Bob would never access the client database at 3 AM,\" Alice muttered to herself, digging deeper into the logs.\n\nThe next morning, Alice caught Mallory attempting to download sensitive client information using Bob's stolen credentials. Within minutes, security was escorting Mallory out of the building, while Bob stood in disbelief, finally understanding how he'd been manipulated.\n\n\"I should have known better,\" Bob said to Alice later that day over coffee.\n\nAlice smiled sympathetically. \"That's why we have security protocols\u2014and friends who watch each other's backs.\"\n\nThe End\n\nThis story incorporates themes of cybersecurity, trust, and friendship, with Mallory playing the traditional role of the antagonist trying to exploit the trust between Alice and Bob.", "Here's a short story featuring Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Setup\n\nAlice drummed her fingers on the caf\u00e9 table, checking her watch for the third time in five minutes.

She smiled as she saw Mallory enter through the front door, right on schedule.\n\n\"Everything set?\" Mallory whispered, sliding into the seat across from Alice.\n\n\"Just like we discussed,\" Alice replied, pushing a small envelope across the table. \"Bob has no idea you're involved.\"\n\nFor months, Bob had been bragging about his supposedly unbreakable security system at his antique shop. It had become something of an obsession for him, constantly updating Alice, his business partner, about every minor improvement.\n\nWhat Bob didn't know was that Alice had been documenting every detail, sharing them with Mallory, their mutual friend from college who now worked as a security consultant. Or at least, that's what she claimed to be.\n\nThe bell above the caf\u00e9 door chimed as Bob rushed in, his face flushed from running. \"Sorry I'm late! Oh, Mallory! What a surprise seeing you here!\"\n\nMallory smiled innocently, tucking the envelope into her jacket. \"Just catching up with Alice. Actually, I was just leaving.\"\n\nThat night, as Bob's security system was expertly circumvented and his most valuable pieces disappeared, he never suspected that his weekly coffee meetings with Alice had been his undoing.

If she had figured out their plan to expose the bank president's embezzlement scheme, everything would fall apart.\n\n\"How much does she know?\" Alice asked, keeping her voice low.\n\n\"Everything,\" Bob replied. \"But here's the twist \u2013 she wants in. She's been collecting evidence of her own for months.\"\n\nAlice sat back, processing this information. Mallory had always seemed like a rule-follower, the type who would report them immediately. But perhaps they had misjudged her.\n\nThat evening, the three met in Mallory's apartment. What started as a tense meeting evolved into a perfect collaboration. Mallory's evidence was the missing piece they needed, and her expertise in computer security would make their exposure of the crime foolproof.\n\nOne week later, as the bank president was led away in handcuffs, the three conspirators shared knowing looks across the office.

They were well aware that Mallory could see their exchange from her vantage point.\n\nWhat Mallory didn't know was that Alice and Bob had discovered her identity weeks ago. The \"security codes\" were fake, and this elaborate setup was designed to feed her false information.

Someone inside the building was trying to access restricted financial records.\n\nBob from accounting sat nearby, humming quietly while reviewing quarterly reports. He'd worked at the firm for fifteen years and was as dependable as they came. Alice had always appreciated his methodical nature, especially now as she traced the digital footprints through the system.\n\nThat's when Mallory from IT support walked by, her heels clicking against the tile floor. \"Having trouble with anything?\" she asked sweetly, placing a coffee on Alice's desk \u2013 just as she had done every morning for the past month.\n\nAlice's eyes narrowed as the pattern suddenly became clear. The unauthorized access attempts had started exactly one month ago. She glanced at the coffee, then at Mallory's too-perfect smile, and noticed Bob watching them both intently over his computer monitor.\n\n\"Actually,\" Alice said, typing a few quick commands, \"I just solved our problem.\" A series of alerts flashed across the building's security systems. Within minutes, security guards were escorting a stunned Mallory out of the building, her keycard collected and her coffee-delivery days over.\n\nLater, Bob brought Alice a proper cup of coffee. \"How did you know it was her?\"\n\n\"The timing was too convenient,\" Alice replied. \"And she always brought coffee right when she was running her password cracker, thinking it would mask her network activity.\"\n\nBob shook his head and smiled. \"Remind me never to get on your bad side.\"\n\nThe End", "Here's a short story featuring Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Crime\n\nAlice checked her watch for the third time in five minutes. The museum's marble lobby felt colder than usual as she pretended to study the ancient Greek pottery in the display case. Bob should have disabled the security cameras by now.\n\nJust then, her phone buzzed with a text: \"Systems down. You have 8 minutes. -B\"\n\nPerfect. Alice casually made her way toward the east wing, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor. The Renaissance painting they'd been planning to steal for months was just around the corner.\n\nWhat neither Alice nor Bob knew was that Mallory had been watching them for weeks. A rival art thief, she had figured out their plan and was already two steps ahead. While Bob was busy with the cameras and Alice created her diversion, Mallory had slipped in through the service entrance, wearing a maintenance uniform.\n\nThe alarm suddenly blared through the building. Alice froze, knowing something had gone wrong. Bob's frantic voice came through her earpiece: \"Someone else is in the system! Get out now!\"\n\nAs security guards rushed toward the east wing, Alice glimpsed a familiar figure slipping out a side door, carrying a thin package wrapped in brown paper. Mallory turned, gave a little wave, and disappeared into the night.\n\nLater that evening, Mallory sat in her apartment, admiring her new acquisition while watching the local news report about the failed heist attempt. She smiled, raising a glass of champagne to the TV screen. \"Better luck next time, amateurs.\"\n\nThe End.", "Here's a short story with Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Setup\n\nAlice drummed her fingers nervously on the coffee shop table, checking her watch for the third time in five minutes. Bob was late, as usual, but that wasn't what worried her. She'd spotted Mallory lurking near the entrance earlier, wearing that signature red scarf she always used when she was up to no good.\n\nBob finally rushed in, his laptop bag swinging wildly as he navigated between tables. \"Sorry I'm late! Did you bring the prototype?\"\n\nAlice nodded and carefully slid a small black box across the table. This was their breakthrough - a quantum encryption device that could revolutionize digital security. They'd spent three years developing it in secret.\n\n\"Let me guess,\" a smooth voice interrupted, \"the Q-780 prototype?\" Mallory slid into the seat between them, her red scarf matching the cruel smile on her lips. \"Your lab security needs work, by the way.\"\n\nAlice's heart sank as she realized Mallory had already stolen their backup data. Bob reached for the prototype, but Mallory was faster, snatching it with practiced ease.\n\n\"Better luck next time,\" Mallory winked, standing up. But as she turned to leave, she froze - the cafe was suddenly surrounded by federal agents. Alice and Bob exchanged knowing smiles.\n\n\"Your predictability needs work, by the way,\" Alice said, mimicking Mallory's tone. The black box on the table was just a decoy, and Mallory had walked right into their trap.\n\nSometimes the perfect setup requires the perfect bait.", "Here's a short story with Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Setup\n\nAlice drummed her fingers on the caf\u00e9 table, checking her watch for the third time in five minutes. Bob was late, as usual. She took another sip of her now-lukewarm coffee and continued watching the door.\n\nFinally, Bob rushed in, his tie askew and briefcase clutched tightly against his chest. \"Sorry I'm late,\" he said, sliding into the chair across from her. \"You won't believe what happened at the office.\"\n\nBefore he could launch into his explanation, Alice leaned forward. \"Never mind that. Did you bring it?\"\n\nBob patted his briefcase and nodded. \"The security codes are all here. But are you sure about this? If anyone finds out...\"\n\n\"That's why we're meeting here instead of the office,\" Alice whispered. \"Nobody would expect it.\"\n\nWhat neither of them noticed was Mallory sitting in the corner booth, hidden behind a newspaper, recording every word. She'd been tracking their movements for weeks, waiting for exactly this moment. As the company's head of security, she'd suspected a potential breach, but hadn't expected it to be her two most trusted employees.\n\nMallory smiled as she sent the recording to her phone. Sometimes the perfect setup was just letting people think they weren't being watched.\n\nAs Alice and Bob concluded their meeting, Mallory quietly slipped out the back door. Tomorrow's confrontation would be interesting indeed.", "Here's a short story featuring Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Plan\n\nAlice checked her watch for the third time in five minutes as she waited outside the coffee shop. Bob was late, as usual, but that wasn't what made her nervous. It was Mallory she was worried about.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late!\" Bob called out, jogging up to her with his characteristic goofy smile. \"Traffic was terrible.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Alice replied, ushering him inside. \"But we need to hurry. Mallory could show up any minute.\"\n\nThey had been planning this for weeks. Bob had \"accidentally\" let slip to Mallory about a valuable antique at the shop, knowing her reputation as a local fence for stolen goods. What Mallory didn't know was that Alice was an undercover detective, and Bob was her informant.\n\nRight on schedule, Mallory walked in, her sharp eyes scanning the vintage items on display. Alice pretended to be absorbed in her laptop while Bob played his part as the oblivious barista.\n\nThe trap was set perfectly, but then something unexpected happened. Mallory walked straight to their table and sat down.\n\n\"Nice try, you two,\" she smirked. \"But next time you plan a sting, make sure your informant isn't wearing a wire that's visible under his shirt.\"\n\nBob's face turned red as he touched his chest where the wire was poorly hidden. Alice could only laugh \u2013 sometimes the simplest mistakes were the costliest.\n\nTo their surprise, Mallory pulled out a badge of her own. \"By the way, I'm with the FBI. Your small-time fence was getting too close to my three-year operation. Better luck next time.\"\n\nWith that, she stood up and walked out, leaving Alice and Bob staring at each other in disbelief.", "Here's a short story featuring Alice, Bob, and Mallory:\n\nThe Perfect Setup\n\nAlice drummed her fingers on the coffee shop table, checking her watch for the third time in five minutes. Bob was late again, but that was all part of the plan. She smiled as she saw Mallory enter through the front door, right on schedule.\n\n\"Alice! What a coincidence,\" Mallory exclaimed with practiced surprise, sliding into the seat across from her. Alice knew there was nothing coincidental about it \u2013 Mallory had been watching Bob's patterns for weeks.\n\n\"Oh, hi Mallory,\" Alice replied, feigning mild discomfort. \"I'm actually waiting for Bob...\"\n\n\"Of course you are,\" Mallory said with a knowing smirk. \"He's always late, isn't he?\"\n\nJust then, Bob burst through the door, his cheeks flushed from running. He stopped short when he saw Mallory sitting at his and Alice's usual table. His face fell slightly, and Alice felt a twinge of guilt.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" he managed, pulling up a chair.\n\nWhat Bob didn't know was that Alice and Mallory had orchestrated this entire meeting. They weren't really competing for his attention as he believed \u2013 they were best friends testing whether Bob was dating them both. His reaction to seeing them together confirmed their suspicions.\n\nAs Bob squirmed uncomfortably between them, Alice and Mallory exchanged a subtle glance. The trap had worked perfectly.
